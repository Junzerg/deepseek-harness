# AGENTS.md

Lingxi Office is a DeepSeek Harness fork for the desktop application and intranet distribution.

## Working agreements

- Keep each iteration within the user's confirmed scope and acceptance criteria. Make the smallest complete change; defer unrelated refactoring, cleanup, and fixes.
- Apply a reference design only to the region and behaviors being discussed. Preserve existing capabilities whose removal or redesign the user has not confirmed; list unresolved product choices separately.
- Complete authorized work autonomously. Ask only for a real blocker, a material product or risk decision, overlapping user work, or missing authorization. Explain the concrete dependency and impact before expanding scope.
- Prefer one owner. Add planning phases, subagents, review rounds, or process documents only when requested or required by the change's risk.
- Read the applicable instructions and source needed for the change; reuse already-read guidance while it remains current.
- For user-led UI iterations, discuss, implement, and verify one region at a time. Provide a runnable preview or screenshot as soon as the change is reviewable; complete necessary verification, then hand off for user review before starting another region.

## Conventions

- Before changing `packages/` or `vendor/`, read [architecture](docs/architecture.md) and the applicable subtree instructions. For vendored updates, follow [vendor/README.md](vendor/README.md).
- Desktop credentials belong in git-ignored `apps/desktop/.env.windows`. Files end with exactly one trailing newline.

## Commands

Use pnpm and Node >=24.9. [package.json](package.json) owns the commands; `dev:desktop` builds then launches, while `start:*` skips the build.

## Verification

- Use [testing policy](docs/testing.md) to select the smallest checks covering the changed behavior and risk, together with required project checks; do not default to the full suite. Reuse passing results unless later changes, failures, or unresolved concerns invalidate them.
- Report unrelated check failures separately; do not automatically expand the repair scope. If a failure blocks the agreed outcome, explain why and identify the necessary fix.
- When a required check is costly, state its purpose and expected cost. Report the result, validation, and remaining limitations concisely; once acceptance criteria and necessary checks are satisfied, hand off without starting additional work.
- Before pushing, follow [pre-push checks](.agents/skills/dsh-pre-push-checks/SKILL.md).

## Desktop and intranet work

Read the [packaging guide](apps/desktop/packaging/README.zh.md) for builds and [intranet release reference](apps/desktop/packaging/INTRANET.md) before release preparation, diagnosis, publishing, or rollback. This machine cannot reach the intranet server: do not probe it or assume SSH access; provide commands for the user to run there.
