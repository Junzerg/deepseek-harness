## Summary

This package provides the Web GUI's three-column AppFrame, edge-column widths, and `ctx.layout` presentation control. The right column concedes space before the center; its occupant renders fullscreen while the frame retains the wide-screen track underneath. The theme presenter owns color scheme, alias tokens, font sizes, font lists, and document metadata. Layout state resets on reload.

## Use this package

The root slot composes a fixed 236px sidebar, flexible main content, and a fixed 336px right panel. Above 1180px an open right panel reserves its own column; at 1180px or below it overlays the main content without reducing its width. Column and panel transitions take 180ms. The left sidebar always stays expanded at 236px; only the right panel can be opened and closed. The outer columns have no width-resize handles.

Global panels occupy the root-scoped `main` keyed slot; `conversation` is the reserved key for the Conversation. `ctx.layout.selectPanel(id)` selects a registered panel, and `null` selects the Conversation without changing the current Session. The Plugins page contributes one of the shipped global panels.

The single root-scoped `shell.bottom` slot spans the full width below the three columns. Its occupant controls its own height and visibility; the columns shrink by that height, and empty content reserves no space. Main-panel navigation preserves the bottom component. `shell.overlay` covers the whole frame. The default composition leaves this slot empty.

### Window-chrome seat

On macOS desktop (`html[data-platform='darwin']`, set only by the desktop preload) the left sidebar stays expanded, with a top strip clearing the hiddenInset traffic lights. The frame publishes `--dsh-frame-top-clearance` (48px) on the root element for entry pages in the main panel. Each chrome row marks itself `data-window-drag`, which ui-web base.css maps to the darwin drag rule; blank runs drag the window while controls stay clickable. The frame's own drag rule belongs only to the Windows caption row.

Windows Electron's `data-windows-titlebar` marker reserves the caption height above all columns. Only the content area's top-left corner has a 16px radius; the other corners and the internal divider remain square. The frame publishes `--dsh-windows-content-radius` and `--dsh-windows-sidebar-width` for ui-sidebar-right's fullscreen corner and sidebar clearance. Ordinary Web documents do not receive the marker; macOS retains its separate layout.

The root publishes `--dsh-frame-top-clearance` for the reserved strip (48px on macOS, the caption height on Windows), and `--dsh-frame-overlay-top` adds 20px for dialogs and menus. Native fullscreen reduces the overlay inset to 20px; dialogs retain their own 24px minimum. `--dsh-frame-chrome-top` excludes the Windows caption from modal mask painting and becomes zero in fullscreen. The full-viewport modal layer still blocks background clicks. Plain browser documents publish none of these values.

### Theme presentation

The presenter consumes resolved theme snapshots and projects them onto the document: `html { color-scheme }` for native UA chrome, `body[data-ds-dark-theme]` from the active color scheme, the theme's alias tokens, `--dsh-content-font-size`, `--dsh-code-font-size`, `--dsh-terminal-font-size`, and each non-empty `--dsh-font-family-<role>` list as inline variables on body, and one owned `<meta name="theme-color">` whose content follows the computed body background. Disposing the presenter removes its metadata node with its other global writes.

## Understand the implementation

<details>
<summary>Implementation internals — click to expand</summary>

`selectPanel(id)` checks the live `main` registry before changing selection; an absent key throws and leaves the current panel intact. `beginNavigation()` returns an abort signal for an asynchronous UI navigation. A later call, a valid panel selection (including repeated selection), or layout disposal aborts that signal without cancelling underlying Session creation. Consumers check the signal before committing navigation or moving drafts.

One registration declares the frame slots and binds `ctx.layout` methods `selectPanel`, `openRightbar(track, fullscreen)`, and `closeRightbar`. One root store separates `panelInfo` selection from `layoutInfo` measurements and presentation reports. `ctx.layout.panelInfo` and the standard `usePanelInfo` hook share the same selection source; AppFrame subscribes to the stable layout object. The `rightbar` owner supplies fixed `width`, current `viewportWidth`, and opening eligibility `canShow`. Narrow frames keep the panel available as an overlay. Explicit fullscreen retains the normal track on wide frames. AppFrame keeps the column containers mounted. The right column's root controller renders `rightbar.session` through `SessionProvider` only while the Conversation is selected; its unmount report releases the track. The independent title component uses the selected Session title only while the Conversation is visible, with the build-configured product title or localized `common.brand.localBuild` as its fallback; locale revisions update that fallback. The theme presenter is a second effect: pure DOM writes from resolved snapshots — initial state through the getter once, then event-driven only, with no React path. It applies palette, font-size, font-list, and token variables before measuring the rendered background as the single color authority. Fullscreen presentation suppresses grid transitions; its occupant reports the new columns only after covering the frame. Fullscreen exit keeps transitions suppressed while the frame installs its destination geometry: close removes the right track, and restore retains it. Subsequent normal geometry actions restore ordinary transitions.

## Further Exploration

Read these pages when the layout surface is not enough. They move from the frame to the columns it renders and the theme it presents.

- [ui-sidebar](../ui-sidebar/README.md) — occupies the `sidebar` column and its seats.
- [ui-conversation](../ui-conversation/README.md) — occupies the `main` key `conversation`.
- [ui-sidebar-right](../ui-sidebar-right/README.md) — occupies the `rightbar` column with one docking surface per session.
- [ui-theme](../ui-theme/README.md) — the theme seam whose resolved snapshots the presenter consumes.
- [Web client architecture](../../../docs/subsystems/web-client.md) — how browser plugin rows load and register slots.

## Model Experience

None, as the layout shell manages browser viewing state; nothing here reaches a model request.

#### KV Cache effect

None; this package neither assembles nor sends a provider request.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>


These limits define the current layout behavior. They are current package constraints, not a general window-manager comparison or a task backlog.

- **Panel geometry is transient** — the right panel uses its selected Session’s saved expanded state; frame measurements are not persisted.
- **Narrow windows** — the 236px sidebar always stays expanded, and the 336px right overlay covers part of the main content.
- **Column and panel motion share timing** — the frame publishes `--dsh-layout-transition-duration` and `--dsh-layout-transition-easing` as 180ms and `ease`. Column and panel transitions read both variables; explicit fullscreen geometry changes are immediate.
- **No scroll anchoring during squeeze reflow** — layout changes may move the reader's viewport.
